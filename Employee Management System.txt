Project Name: Employee Management System
------------------------------------------
**Description**: Create a system to manage employee records, track attendance, and generate payroll.
**Key Features**:
- Use of PL/SQL for data manipulation.
- Triggers for attendance tracking.
- Stored procedures for payroll calculation.
- Data validation and error handling.


Designing an architecture for an Employee Management System using Oracle involves several layers and components to ensure efficient data management, integrity, and performance. Here's a detailed architecture design:

**Database Schema Design**
---------------------------------

**Tables**:
- **Employees**: Stores employee details.
- **Attendance**: Tracks daily attendance.
- **Payroll**: Manages payroll information.
- **Departments**: Stores department details.
- **Notifications**: Manages notifications for overdue tasks or alerts.

**Example Schema**:

**Employees Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_name VARCHAR2(100),
  department_id NUMBER,
  hire_date DATE,
  salary NUMBER,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);  

**Attendance Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE attendance (
  attendance_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id NUMBER,
  checkin_date DATE,
  checkout_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);  

**Payroll Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE payroll (
  payroll_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id NUMBER,
  pay_date DATE,
  amount NUMBER,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);  

**Departments Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR2(100)
);  

**Notifications Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  notification_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id NUMBER,
  message VARCHAR2(255),
  notification_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);  

  2. **PL/SQL for Data Manipulation**

**Example**: Basic CRUD operations for managing employee records.

**Create**:
  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_employee (
  p_employee_id IN NUMBER,
  p_employee_name IN VARCHAR2,
  p_department_id IN NUMBER,
  p_hire_date IN DATE,
  p_salary IN NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id, hire_date, salary)
  VALUES (p_employee_id, p_employee_name, p_department_id, p_hire_date, p_salary);
  COMMIT;
END;  

**Read**:
  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_employee (
  p_employee_id IN NUMBER,
  p_employee_name OUT VARCHAR2,
  p_department_id OUT NUMBER,
  p_hire_date OUT DATE,
  p_salary OUT NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
  SELECT employee_name, department_id, hire_date, salary
  INTO p_employee_name, p_department_id, p_hire_date, p_salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = p_employee_id;
END;  

**Update**:
  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_employee (
  p_employee_id IN NUMBER,
  p_employee_name IN VARCHAR2,
  p_department_id IN NUMBER,
  p_hire_date IN DATE,
  p_salary IN NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees
  SET employee_name = p_employee_name,
      department_id = p_department_id,
      hire_date = p_hire_date,
      salary = p_salary
  WHERE employee_id = p_employee_id;
  COMMIT;
END;  

**Delete**:
  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE delete_employee (
  p_employee_id IN NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = p_employee_id;
  COMMIT;
END;  

  3. **Triggers for Attendance Tracking**

**Example**: Trigger to record attendance when an employee checks in.

  
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_record_attendance
AFTER INSERT ON checkins
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO attendance (employee_id, checkin_date)
  VALUES (:NEW.employee_id, :NEW.checkin_date);
END;  

  4. **Stored Procedures for Payroll Calculation**

**Example**: Stored procedure to calculate payroll for all employees.

  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE calculate_payroll AS
BEGIN
  FOR rec IN (SELECT employee_id, salary FROM employees) LOOP
    INSERT INTO payroll (employee_id, pay_date, amount)
    VALUES (rec.employee_id, SYSDATE, rec.salary);
  END LOOP;
  COMMIT;
END;  

  5. **Data Validation and Error Handling**

**Example**: Procedure with data validation and error handling.

  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_employee_with_validation (
  p_employee_id IN NUMBER,
  p_employee_name IN VARCHAR2,
  p_department_id IN NUMBER,
  p_hire_date IN DATE,
  p_salary IN NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
  IF p_salary < 0 THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Salary cannot be negative');
  END IF;

  INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id, hire_date, salary)
  VALUES (p_employee_id, p_employee_name, p_department_id, p_hire_date, p_salary);
  COMMIT;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    ROLLBACK;
    RAISE;
END;  

  Additional Considerations

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure referential integrity using foreign keys.
- **Security**: Use roles and privileges to secure sensitive data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use indexes and optimize queries for better performance.

This architecture will help you build a robust Employee Management System using Oracle, demonstrating your ability to handle complex SQL queries, use PL/SQL for business logic, and ensure data integrity and error handling.
